Feww. Finally learned how to create a blog on GitHub.io. Thank J. McGlone for the [nice instruction](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/). This blog is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and posts are written using Markdown syntax (see [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)).
