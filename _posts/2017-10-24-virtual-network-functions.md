Some definitions and principles of Network Function Virtualization (NFV) that need to bear in mind:

- NFV aims at migrating network functions (e.g., DPI (Deep Packet Inspection), firewalling, media gateways, intrusion detection and caching), from dedicated harware devices to software instances running on virtualized networking and computing infrastructures named NFV Infrastructure (NFVI) [Alleg2017]. In other words, NFV transforms network functions (NFs) to software-based application running over NFVI.

- As real-time applications are composed of a chain of different NFs (e.g., content processing, transcoder, media gateways, etc.), it requires some requirements such as [Alleg2017]:

* Strict latency requirement, e.g., for VoIP and video streaming
* 


## Virtual Network Functions (VNFs)
Problems that come up with VNFs can be listed here: 

* Placement
* Chaining
* Management
* Scheduling
* Orchestration
